sublimeInstall
==============

To use Sublime Text 2 as default text editor, add this to the "~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list" under defaults:

```
application/x-perl=sublime.desktop
text/plain=sublime.desktop
text/x-chdr=sublime.desktop
text/x-csrc=sublime.desktop
text/x-dtd=sublime.desktop
text/x-java=sublime.desktop
text/mathml=sublime.desktop
text/x-python=sublime.desktop
text/x-sql=sublime.desktop
text/xml=sublime.desktop
```

I will implement that in the next few days or weeks to the install script. Has no priority for me at the moment.
